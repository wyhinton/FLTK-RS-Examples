#
# FLTKConfig.cmake - FLTK CMake configuration file for external projects.
#
# This file is generated by CMake and used to load FLTK's settings for
# an external project.
#
# It defines the following variables:
#
#  FLTK_INCLUDE_DIRS     - FLTK include directories
#  FLTK_LIBRARIES        - list of FLTK libraries built (not yet implemented)
#  FLTK_FLUID_EXECUTABLE - needed by the function FLTK_RUN_FLUID
#                          (or the deprecated fltk_wrap_ui() CMake command)
#
#  FLTK_USE_FILE - previously used to set things up to use FLTK
#                - deprecated since FLTK 1.3.4
#                - will be removed in FLTK 1.4.0 or later
